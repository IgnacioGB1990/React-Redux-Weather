## Overview of Redux:

Redux contains our application state which is generated by a serious of reducers that we write. That state is then modified by calling action creators. Actions creators return actions which flow through middlewares and into the reducers. Whenever a new set of state is produced it flows into our containers and those containers re-render themselves and the entire process repeats all over again.
